## Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree - Udacity
Will add additional notebooks as progress through the course continues.
* ParallelParking.ipynb (Parallel Parking) - notebook to specify distance values for simulated self-driving car performing a parallel parking maneuver. Other option was to base this on time, but that had more variability, so chose distance (since it's absolute).
